What are the differences between var, let and const?
Variables declared with var can have a global or local scope.
Variables declared with var can be redeclared and reassigned.
Variables declared with let can have a global, local, or block scope. Block scope is for variables declared in a block. A block in JavaScript involves opening and closing curly braces
just like var, variables declared with let can be reassigned to other values, but they cannot be redeclared.
Variables declared with const are similar to let in regards to scope. Such variables can have a global, local, or block scope.
variables cannot be redeclared, and neither can they be reassigned to other values.

Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN?
"undefined" and "not defined" are two different values in JavaScript. "undefined" indicates that a variable has been declared but not given a value, while "not defined" indicates that a variable does not exist.
"undefined" and "not defined" are two different values in JavaScript. "undefined" indicates that a variable has been declared but not given a value, while "not defined" indicates that a variable does not exist.

What is difference between null and undefined and where to use what?
Null represents an empty value and carry no meaningful information.
Undefined - Undefined represents any value that has not been defined anywhere in the program.
If any variable or operation isn't able to produce a meaningful value, it returns undefined.

What is execution context?
The browser's JavaScript engine then creates a special environment to handle the transformation and execution of this JavaScript code. This environment is known as the Execution Context.
The Execution Context contains the code that's currently running, and everything that aids in its execution.

What is use of prompt in JavaScript?
prompt() is a built-in function that is used to display a dialog box that asks the user to input some text. This pop-up box will appear and takes user input before entering the web page. It waits until the user enters any value in the text box or we can also cancel the dialog box.

Why JavaScript is Dyanmic Language?
In dynamic languages, the types and values are both dynamic, which means the types and values can both be changed. For example, a variable that was previously assigned an integer can be assigned a string. The type checking is done during run time.
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. This means that the types of variables are not declared explicitly, and they can change throughout the program. For example, you can start with a variable that is a string, and then later assign it a number. This would not be possible in a statically typed language, where the types of variables must be declared upfront.
Another reason why JavaScript is considered a dynamic language is because of its prototype-based inheritance system. In this system, objects inherit properties from other objects, rather than from classes. This makes it very easy to create new objects and to extend existing objects.
Finally, JavaScript is a dynamic language because of its execution model. In JavaScript, code is executed immediately, rather than being compiled into machine code. This makes it very flexible and responsive, but it can also lead to performance problems.
